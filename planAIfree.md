Copy
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
2
Make your first request
Use google/gemma-4-31b-it:free with the OpenRouter API:

OpenRouter supports reasoning-enabled models that can show their step-by-step thinking process. Use the reasoning parameter in your request to enable reasoning, and access the reasoning_details array in the response to see the model's internal reasoning before the final answer. When continuing a conversation, preserve the complete reasoning_details when passing messages back to the model so it can continue reasoning from where it left off. Learn more about reasoning tokens.

In the examples below, the OpenRouter-specific headers are optional. Setting them allows your app to appear on the OpenRouter leaderboards.

});

// Stream the response to get reasoning tokens in usage
const stream = await openrouter.chat.send({
  model: "google/gemma-4-31b-it:free",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "How many r's are in the word 'strawberry'?"
    }
  ],
  stream: true
});

let response = "";
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  const content = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content;
  if (content) {
    response += content;
    process.stdout.write(content);
  }

  // Usage information comes in the final chunk
  if (chunk.usage) {
    console.log("\nReasoning tokens:", chunk.usage.reasoningTokens);
  }
}

Enable streaming
Add "stream": true to your request body to receive responses as server-sent events:


Copy
curl -N https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "google/gemma-4-31b-it:free",
  "stream": true,
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
  ]
}'
Endpoint

Parameters
Name	Type	Default	Description
reasoning	map	—	Controls reasoning behavior for models that support thinking tokens, including whether reasoning is enabled, the reasoning effort, maximum reasoning tokens, and whether reasoning is excluded from the response.
temperature	float	1	This setting influences the variety in the model's responses.
max_tokens	integer	—	This sets the upper limit for the number of tokens the model can generate in response.
stop	array	—	Stop generation immediately if the model encounter any token specified in the stop array.
seed	integer	—	If specified, the inferencing will sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result.
tools	array	—	Tool calling parameter, following OpenAI's tool calling request shape.
tool_choice	string or object	—	Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
top_p	float	0.95	This setting limits the model's choices to a percentage of likely tokens: only the top tokens whose probabilities add up to P.
top_k	integer	64	This limits the model's choice of tokens at each step, making it choose from a smaller set.
min_p	float	0	Represents the minimum probability for a token to be considered, relative to the probability of the most likely token.
top_a	float	0	Consider only the top tokens with "sufficiently high" probabilities based on the probability of the most likely token.
